//from the project todo-with-cookies by David Kats in Udemy:

//STORE AND STATE
//the store is an object that contains the state object


//ACTIONS AND ACTION CREATORS
//an action is an object with at least one property called "type"
//an action creator is a function that returns an action object


//REDUCERS AND STATE IMMUTABILITY
//reducers are functions that use the actions to modify the state of the app
//the state of the app is immutable, meaning we cannot change it directly
